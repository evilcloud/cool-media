            <p>The history of the arts and sciences could be written in terms of the continuing process by which new

                new,
                quickly becomes tidied up into an art form, such as is now happening to film since it has become the

        <p>It would be naive to assume that vocative regime is the only mode of popular music consumption by a wide
            audience. The data shows it is not even a dominant mode — YouTube video streaming makes up 46% of all
            streaming
            music worldwide (IFPI Global Music Report 2018, p. 27). Considering the omnipresence of Spotify with its
            massive
            50 million songs catalogue, lower requirement for the bandwidth than YouTube, as well as assured legality of
            the
            content consumption, YouTube’s dominance leads to a safe assumption that the reason for the preference lies
            in
            the visual component.</p>
        <p>Music video is a fairly recent format, even for the relatively young music industry. Traditionally, popular
            music
            was available though broadcast (radio, television), recordings (records, cassette tapes, jukeboxes, and
            other
            media), and live performances (concerts, gigs).</p>
        <img src="media/fleischer.gif">
        <p>The first attempts to combine songs and images came in the 1930s, most notably by Max Fleischer Studio, that
            would cut their Betty Boop cartoons to the songs of Cab Calloway and Louis Armstrong, amongst others.</p>
        <p>Later in the 40s Panoram “Soundies”, jukeboxes with a screen which could show 3 minute long films, were the
            first
            examples of music and image converging technology that was able to alter the atmosphere of the environment
            — Soundies were placed in public spaces, such as hamburger joints, stations, etc. and their presence had
            such positive impact, that within 7 years Mills Novelty Company, the manufacturer of Soundies, has placed
            1850 machines across the United States (Kelley, 2015, p. 72).</p>
        <p><em>Scopitone</em> — an improved variation of Soundies from France was the true first forerunner of music
            videos.
            With colour 16mm film projection and high fidelity magnetic track the devices were specifically designed as
            a
            kind of music clips jukebox. One of the first truly innovative music clips — Bob Dylan’s <em><a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGxjIBEZvx0" target="_blank">Subterranean
                    Homesick Blues</a></em> was filmed in 1965 specifically for Scopitone format as a way to promote the
            album
            (Beattie, K. and Astruc, A., p. 31). With a dedicated format and the method of dispersion, the format of
            music
            clips has started to become popular with the artists and record labels as the way to promote albums. Later
            the
            format of the music clips has been adopted by the broadcast television.</p>
        <h2 id="2-ladies-and-gentlemen-rock-and-roll">2 Ladies and gentlemen! Rock and roll</h2>
        <p>With this phrase on the 1st of August 1981 the first 24 hours specialised programming TV channel focused
            solely
            on music (initially rock music) — MTV — was launched. The first music video MTV has broadcasted, was a
            symbolically gestured <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8r-tXRLazs" target="_blank">Video Killed
                    the Radio Star</a></em> by The Buggles. Despite the initial hesitations
            by
            Warner and the industry in general, the channel has become an instant success (Munk, 2004, p. 93). This is
            when
            music video as the format has received its true prominence in the music industry, and in the contemporary
            culture itself.</p>
        <p>Music videos have become for the bands not only a way to attract new audience, but an integral part of their
            artistic identity. Indeed, the typical music video credits include only artist and record label, eschewing
            the
            ac- knowledgement of other roles in the production is an indicator of push of the celebrity culture
            (Aufderheide, 1986, p. 62) and the mechanicity of the process.</p>
        <p>Because of their centrality in the bands’ success, as well as high conductivity for marketing messages, music
            videos have become a product in itself. The audience, who Bob Pittman, the man behind MTV has famously
            characterised as “television babies, who grew up on TV and rock and roll” (Denisoff, p. 45) have embraced
            the
            new audiovisual sensibility. Advertisers have sensed early the emotional response of the audience to the
            music
            videos and have embraced the visual language of the format. In return the musicians, understanding the
            efficiencies that are inherent to commercials, have embraced these rules as well, thus colliding the
            commercials
            and music videos into one large hyperreal space, where the audience was unable, or unwilling to distinguish
            between entertainment and the sales pitch. The new reality creates experiences with symbols, that stand in
            for
            something else in the real world, thus creating an entirely different world of different meanings produced
            by
            these symbols, and new experiences, that are completely detached from the actual ones – hyperreality
            (Baudrillard and Poster, 2007, p. 143).</p>
        <h2 id="3-youtube-and-audiovisual-convergence">3 YouTube and audiovisual convergence</h2>
        <p>Just like Scopitones have lost their relevance with the advent of broadcast television, so has broadcast
            television’s importance has been diminished with the advent of the internet. Web 2.0 has pushed MTV out of
            music
            niche into reality TV, and YouTube as an omnipresent channel had created a video turn at around 2008 (Holt,
            2001, p. 50). With the rising importance of YouTube as a mode of distribution, the format of the music
            videos
            started to change as well, from wider range of audio-visual experimentations, to self produced videos, to
            music
            videos with high level of “cinemacity”<a href="#section1"><sup>1</sup></a> (<em>ibid</em>, p. 52).</p>
        <h2 id="4-death-grips-and-audiovisual-divergence">4 Death Grips and audiovisual divergence</h2>
        <p>In 2010 two visual artists from Sacramento, California, Zack Hill and Stefan Burnet, have released the first
            album of their band <em>Death Grips</em>. What fol- lowed then for the next decade was a deliberate
            technologically enabled act of nihilism of artistic goals, principles and merits, which can be defined as
            <em>retreatism</em> within the frameworks of Merton’s Anomie theory<a href="#section2"><sup>2</sup></a>.
            Individuals considered to be a part
            of
            retreatist group from sociological perspective are viewed as true “aliens”(Merton, 1938, p. 676), and true
            to
            the definition, multiple interviews with the band members, as well as their actions, have demonstrated their
            disdain for the culturally induced meritocratic principles and aspirations. Substance abuse, occasional
            vagrancy, breaches of contrac- tual obligations with record labels<a href="#section3"><sup>3</sup></a> and
            tour commitments, use of explicit
            imagery<a href="#section4"><sup>4</sup></a>, etc., are commonplace acts of the band.
        </p>
        <p>The format of Death Grips works follows the standard principle of many contemporary bands: music, music
            videos,
            gigs, (somewhat limited) com- munication with fans via social media. What is different however, is the
            content:
            cryptic lyrics filled with violent and convoluted messages, visceral delivery, and confusing music videos,
            of
            only what could be characterised as, extremely low production value. The videos, at least those, that have
            any
            animated elements in them, seem to be an assemblage of random items and scenes that are built around
            atmosphere
            by means of form, rather than inter- textual relation with the lyrical component of the track. Additionally
            the
            actual production and post-production are visibly rough, clearly avoiding the common trope of music videos
            in
            attempting to imitate the reality.</p>
        <p>Of course the use of desecrated visuals in music videos is nothing new — <em>scratch video</em> was an entire
            genre, popular in the 80s, that revolved around the use of damaged, recycled, reused and reappropriated
            material. With the fast paced editing, ironic stance against commercial and pop-cultural icons, and often
            direct
            social criticism, scratch videos were a typical product of 80s postmodernism, and despite its attempts to
            criticise and challenge the modernist aesthetics, the scratch videos were fitting perfectly within the
            aesthetic
            norms of the visually dominating culture. Their existence was within the realms of artistically controlled
            meaning and attempts to manipulate the audience into accepting these meanings. The video material uploaded
            by
            Death Grips on their YouTube channel are none of that.</p>
        <p>Generally the band’s music videos can be classified in following categories:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Band performing (no narrative driver)</li>
            <li>Band or a band member is situated within certain environment, that either involves delivery by the
                frontman
                (MC Ride), or little or no action at all</li>
            <li>MC Ride performs to the camera, while placed within some sort of static “frame”</li>
            <li>Irrelevant objects, either CGI or life, being animated. Occasionally with a non-participating person in
                frame</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The last category is very peculiar — unlike many contemporary music videos that have overload of intertextual
            connection with the world and within itself, here elements in the frame are completely isolated from any
            context
            and are suspended within their own syntagmatic relationship. The effect of this suspension is hermeneutic
            coding
            that create the aura of mystery, the uncanny. However, the meaning is entirely open-ended and is left
            entirely
            to the reader to find it, <em>or not</em>. This creates a typical postmod- ern expression with displaced
            space
            and time continuum, albeit created in a rather unusual style for the medium. One way or the other, instead
            of
            the audiovisual convergence, which is the norm for current state of music videos, the band is separating
            these
            streams, diverging them. This type of revolt against the visual by its own means is the recurring pattern in
            the
            bands videos.</p>
        <p>Another interesting category is the third — while intertextually the iconic “frames” are meaning producing
            devices on both indexical and sym- bolic levels, the dichotomy between the high energy of MC Ride’s delivery
            and
            the banality of the “frames”, such as in videos <em>Double Helix</em> and <em>Inanimate Sensation</em>, are
            so
            striking, that the audience hardly can make mistake about the single most important element on the screen.
            The
            mockery these videos make of the constraints of scopic regime are explicit and deliberate.</p>
        <p>As mentioned previously, the video works look like the creators went through a great effort to wipe any
            possible
            meanings out of anything non- song related. Whether deliberately or not, the band is attempting to sepa-
            rate
            music from the visual, back to its pre-MTV condition, akin to <em>Subterranean Homesick Blues</em>, where
            the
            centrality of Bob Dylan and his perfor- mance was not only dominant, but also the single meaning producing
            element<a href="#section5"><sup>5</sup></a>. Perhaps this also could explain the overwhelming number of
            tracks with nothing but the album
            cover
            for the visual on their YouTube channel, or the videos with completely irrelevant animated objects. Lev
            Manovich
            claims that according to Dziga Vertov’s theories “film can overcome its in- dexical nature though montage,
            by
            presenting a viewer with objects that never existed in reality”(Manovich, 2001, p. xviii). With aggressive
            post-
            production technique and denial of direct symbolic connections, the videos create empty space for indexical
            relationship with the objects on the screen. The most exciting part of band’s visual work is the clear
            attempt
            to reject the visual dominance over the music, as well as the attempt to reduce the hyperreal by creating
            visibility of division between different components of the music video.</p>
        <h2 id="5-artefact-as-multi-experiential-media-object">5 Artefact as multi-experiential media object</h2>
        <p>In order to demonstrate the underwhelming power of the video component in the Death Grip videos I have
            created an
            artefact — a set of “simulations” of Death Grips’ music videos<a href="#section6"><sup>6</sup></a>. These
            simulations are essentially a
            completely isolated visual component of the respective music videos — removed are the music, the lyrics, the
            sound, the artists themselves, their performance, the timeline. What is left is the superficial visual
            frame,
            that represents the only relatively stable narrative element in their music videos. The purpose is to
            demonstrate tasks carried out by the band’s performance versus the tasks done by the visuals.</p>
        <p>The bands’ performance within the frame has been replaced with the direct webcam stream of the reader/viewer.
            The
            viewer then is invited to observe the personal reaction to the seen, altering own behaviours on the screen.
            The
            viewer is also encouraged to attempt to imitate the band members as well. This is a highly experiential
            experiment, and a lot of effort was committed to prevent the viewer to attempt to view the experiment
            without
            actual participation, i.e., not having the face in the camera.</p>
        <p>The artefact was built using comparable principles, as used by the band in creating the music videos. Further
            below I will outline the similarities:</p>
